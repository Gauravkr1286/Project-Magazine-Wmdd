            <h1>MS Dhoni’s 2011 World Cup winning six eternalised at Mumbai’s Wankhede stadium</h1>
            <p class="meta">By <strong>Cricket Historian</strong> | December 2, 2024</p>
            <img src="images/MS Dhoni Iconic World Cup Six.webp" alt="MS Dhoni’s Iconic World Cup Six" class="article-img">
            
            <p>This spot at Wankhede Stadium would be auctioned by Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) and the funds collected would be used to sponsor the emerging players.
            </p>
            <p>In 2011, MS Dhoni hit the winning runs at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium, bringing the World Cup home after a wait of 28 years. The spot where the ball rested when Dhoni struck six off former Sri Lankan bowler Nuwan Kulasekara has been given a special touch for fans. The official X handle of Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) shared a picture of the memorial named ‘World Cup 2011 Victory Memorial stand’.

                “The two seats where MS Dhoni’s 2011 ODI World Cup winning six landed at the Wankhede Stadium will forever be symbolic to every cricket fan,” wrote the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) while sharing a picture on X. The seats bearing the numbers J 282-286, nestled in the fifth row of the pavilion, are now adorned with two replicas of World Cup trophies. It even has a photograph of Team India posing with the 2011 trophy.

            <h1>Team India-Struggling batters brace for tough test at the Gabba</h1>
            <p class="meta">By <strong>Cricket Historian</strong> | December 2, 2024</p>
            <img src="images/Team India Tour of Australia.webp" alt="Team Inidia" class="article-img">
            
            <p>We're back where we started with the series level and two teams with both promise and flaws squaring off again on fabled turf. The cricket has been compelling, at times unpredictable. There's even been a little heat between the players. The 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy is veering dangerously close to classic territory. Imagine if it's 2-2 going into Sydney.
            </p>
            <p>Australia are blooding in a new opener and their two most reliable run-scorers aren't operating at the levels they're used to. India will be able to sympathise because like Marnus Labuschagne and Steven Smith, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma (who could be returning as opener) have been more down than up. The last three are in their mid to late 30s, so their form comes with added scrutiny, on top of the surprise that these high-profile players are yet to really influence this high-profile series. (Kohli has a century but the match-winning innings there came from Yashasvi Jaiswal)

            <h1>IPL 2025 Schedule: Time Table, Teams, Auction Details, Match List</h1>
            <p class="meta">By <strong>Cricket Historian</strong> | December 2, 2024</p>
            <img src="images/Ipl schedule.webp" alt="Ipl schedule" class="article-img">
            
            <p>Cricket fans, get ready for another season of high-voltage action! This IPL would be special for a lot of reasons. Firstly, IPL legend Rohit Sharma can possibly find a new team after serving Mumbai Indians for more than a decade.

                Also, The ICC T20 World Cup just concluded, and many players, both Indian and of other nationalities enjoyed the limelight at the highest stage of the game. Saurabh Netravalkar, Andre Ghouz, Fazal al Faruqi, Harry Brook, etc, are some great examples. Franchises would be looking out for them.
            </p>
            <p>The curtain has fallen on the IPL 2024 season, and excitement is already building for the next edition. However, with a mega-auction looming large, discussions are currently focused on two key aspects:

                Retention Policy and Player Retention:  The retention policy for the mega-auction has been announced by the Indian Premier League. Now, with a purse of 120 Crore and a few new rules, franchises are strategizing which players to keep and build their teams around
                
                Scheduling Conflicts with Other T20 Leagues: The proliferation of T20 leagues worldwide has created a logistical nightmare – scheduling these tournaments to avoid clashes for players participating in multiple leagues.
